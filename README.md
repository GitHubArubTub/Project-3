Based on the financial metrics provided, it appears that PTON is not as profitable, liquid, or solvent as its peers. In terms of profitability, PTON has an operating margin of -42.75% and a gross margin of 32.98%, both of which are significantly lower than the average operating margin and gross margin of 5.06% and 38.76% among its peers, respectively. This indicates that PTON is not as efficient in its operations as its peers and is not generating as much profit from its sales. In terms of liquidity, PTON has a current ratio and quick ratio of 2.15 and 1.20, respectively, which are both lower than the average current ratio and quick ratio of 1.92 and 0.88 among its peers. This indicates that PTON has less cash and assets on hand to cover its short-term obligations than its peers. In terms of solvency, PTON has a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.63, which is significantly higher than the average debt-to-equity ratio of 0.86 among its peers. This indicates that PTON has a higher amount of debt relative to its equity, which may make it more difficult for the company to repay its debts.

Overall, the financial metrics indicate that PTON is not as profitable, liquid, or solvent as its peers. There are some alarming disparities in the company's profitability, liquidity, and solvency, which could indicate potential risks for the company.
